The client acts as a DNS stub, wraps DNS requests into RPC requests. 

Run `client --help` for an overview of its options.

To encrypt requests, generate keys using `crpc-keygen` from the clusterrpc
repository (https://github.com/dermesser/clusterrpc). Supply the public key to the client
using the `--pubkeyfile` option.
